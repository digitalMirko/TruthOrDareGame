# TruthOrDareGame
Android (Java) - Truth or Dare Game App

App created in Android Studio 3.2.1 and tested on a Google Nexus 5X API 28 Android 9 Emulator

To use this app the user just clicks the 'Truth or Dare' game app icon and they are taken right into the game. 
They are greeted with a blue bottle graphic on the top and a 'Spin the Bottle' button below.
All the user has to do is click the button and the bottle will start to spin around. As the bottle spins around, the button 
changes color and is locked out from being used. Once the bottle finishes spinning the button will change color and it is ready to use again.

Coming soon: Screen cap images of the app in use can be found on <a href="http://digitalmirko.com/javaApps.html">Digital Mirko</a>.
